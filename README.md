Instructions:
1) When watching videos, enable 'Theater Mode' instead of 'Standard View' to get the most out of the black background, and for an overall more pleasant viewing experience.
2) To view Recommended videos, make a search on the homepage and then click on the YouTube logo next to the search bar. (only for Firefox, on Chrome, it redirects back to the simple homepage)
